## üöÄ About Our Project

In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, determining whether a food product is suitable for someone with specific health conditions can be difficult. Understanding labels, nutritional values, and ingredient details takes time and expertise. This becomes critical for individuals with diseases like diabetes, where sugar, sodium, or other components must be closely monitored.

**NutriScan** simplifies this process.

Just by scanning a barcode, NutriScan analyzes the product and instantly provides detailed nutritional insights such as sugar, fat, protein, and sodium content. The app cross-references this data with the user's health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, or allergies, to assess whether the product is safe or poses any health risks.

Our platform also goes a step further by suggesting healthier alternatives that better align with the user's dietary requirements, encouraging sustainable and healthy eating habits.
